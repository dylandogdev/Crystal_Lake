This project will track the characters in the Friday the 13th movies, including their names, "type" (e.g. counselor, townie, camper), films appeared in, death, whether they're a final girl, and more. 

This project uses a MySql database with tables for Person, Position (type), and Movie. There are bridge tables for Person/Position and Person/Movie to allow for many -> many relationships.

This project is being developed with test-driven development, with red-to-green refactoring for each new method.\

The client side of this project will use Ajax calls to interact with the server, as well as JSPs. 

**This project and its ReadMe are under construction!**
